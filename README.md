## BalzamingMobs

---

*Found it in my folder and decided to post it into Github. 
This plugin was made in 2022, and i didn't make a JavaDock, 
wrote Ukrainian comments and injected strings directly in methods.
I won't change anything due to archive this as my program's skill in 2022,
so don't judge it too strict*

## General Information
This plugin allows you to embalm mobs by taking a sample 
from the Warden, extracting blood with a syringe, and
using it on the mobs. In this state, their intelligence
and gravity are disabled, allowing them to be used as
statues. Additionally, it is possible to reverse the
embalming process. There is also a feature to embalm
bosses with special syringes.
